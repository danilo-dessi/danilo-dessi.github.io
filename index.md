## About me

I am Danilo from [Zeddiani](https://goo.gl/maps/FP2gppLAMGmvkLBN7), a small village in the wonderful [Sardinia](https://goo.gl/maps/uMkwRB2PYKUQZ3vC8).
I am an enthusiast young computer scientist. I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Cagliari who would like to continue his professional growth doing research. I am curious about how things work and interested to learn new ones. I like to push up myself to address more and more challenging tasks. I would like to continue building my carrier in computer science research areas such as Machine Learning, Semantic Web, and Sentiment Analysis which I have been working on during the last three years.

## Short bio

I got the B.Sc. (2014) and M.Sc. (2016) degrees in Computer Science at University of Cagliari.

My B.Sc. thesis treats mobile payment technologies and recommendation systems to improve business revenues between costumers and sellers. For my Master Thesis, I worked at a regional project of the Sardinia government named *Rete Natura 2000: Valutazione dei piani di gestione e studio dei corridoi ecologici come rete complessa*. The Thesis, titled *A Complex Network approach to evaluate the Natura 2000 network*, shows an analysis of the network on the regional land to support enviromental regional planners.

From Academic Year 2015/2016 to 2018/2019 I was academic tutor of the Computer Architecture course of the B.Sc. degree in Computer Science at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science of the University of Cagliari.

From June to September 2016, I was in Eindhoven (The Netherlands) for an internship at Data Science Department of Philips Research under the supervision of [Sergio Consoli](http://stlab.istc.cnr.it/stlab/staff/sergio-consoli/). With Dr. Sergio Consoli, I explored the IBM Watson framework for experimenting its applications on the Healthcare domain.

At the moment, I am Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science of the University of Cagliari supervised by the Professor [Diego Reforgiato](http://people.unica.it/diegoreforgiato/). My research activity mainly focuses on Machine Learning and Semantic Web technologies. 

During my Ph.D. studies, I had the opportunity to visit many research centers around the world. I was visiting student for 3 months in fall 2017 of the Professor [Dennis Shasha](https://cs.nyu.edu/shasha/) at the Center for Data Science of the New York University. With the team of Professor Shasha, we developed a tool called Supernoder aimed at simplifying the search of patterns on biological networks.

I was also visiting student of the Professor [Enrico Motta](http://people.kmi.open.ac.uk/motta/) at the Knowledge Media Institute of the Open University from September to December 2018. From January 2019 to April 2019, I was visiting student at the LIPN in Paris under the supervision of Professor [Davide Buscaldi](https://sites.google.com/site/davidebuscaldi/). During these periods, I worked on text mining techniques that exploit both Machine Learning and Semantic Web technologies for extracting knowledge from scientific literature in order to build a scientific knowledge graph. This work is currently my main research topic. 

Currently, I am looking for post-doc applications in Europe.
